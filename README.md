### About
I realized
1. LLMs are good at translating text, especially incorporating contextual nuance that apps like google translate might miss
2. Most translating tools can only output one language at a time, why not have it be multi output?
3. Anki cards are troublesome to make, AI could help with formatting
4. It's easier to remember words when they are linked to situations and real world usage

So this tool takes in a word, the context you wanted to use it in, and the language to be outputed, then creates anki cards for you to use for revision.
